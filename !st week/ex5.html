          I have been creating <i>challenges</i> since <b>November 22, 2019</b>. 
          Since then I have created challenfes such as<br>
          <i>30 Days of HTML, 30 Days of Javascript, 30 Days of Python</i> and <i>30 Days of React</i>.
          The <b><mark>30 Days of <br> Javascript</mark></b> is the most popular among the four challenges. 
          While I was preparing this challenges, I was <br> taking lots of caffeine 
          (C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>10</sub>N<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and water (H<sub>2</sub>O) but I didn't take any beer(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH) instead I was<br>
          taking more <u>juice</u>. Do you think the cmparison is correct, 2<sup>10</sup> = 1024 ?
          If you are answer is yes, then you <br> know <u>exponential</u>.

          Lines of a poem are short
          It could be two or eight
          Not too short and not too long
          Lines of compact meaning 
          Goes from left to right
          That rhymes at each end
          The space should be reserved
